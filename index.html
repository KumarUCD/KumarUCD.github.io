			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a 
			piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
			McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
			the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through

			 Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The 
			Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the

			"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain 
			was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings
			 of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes,
			  or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
			  pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone w
			  ho loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally 
			  circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
			   which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
			    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
				 or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

			<p style="font-size:150%;text-align:left;">TSection 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis 
				praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non
				 provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum 
				 quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque 
				 nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus.
				  Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae
				   sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus

			<p style="font-size:150%;text-align:left;">T1914 translation by H. Rackham</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%">"On the other hand, we denounce 
			with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by 
			the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee 
			the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who 
			fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through 
			shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
			 In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our 
			 being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
			  But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business 
			  it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The 
			  wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects 
			  pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
